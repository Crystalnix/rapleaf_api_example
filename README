Simple Rapleaf API (https://www.rapleaf.com/) example. Every year there is Boost Con
conference in USA, Colorado for active boost developers. I took ~500 most active developers
from boost-devel mailing list and wrote python module which calculates average distance between
them with help of Google Distance Matrix API (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/distancematrix/).

All you need to provide to the application is list of places where conference is considered to take place,
one place per line (see file dest for example).

1. Dependencies 
	pip install rapleafApi

2. Usage Example
	>>> import BestConferenceLocation
	>>> result = BestConferenceLocation('./emails').match('./dest')
	>>> print result
		('New York, NY, USA', 642.756444)
